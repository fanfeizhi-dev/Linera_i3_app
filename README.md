# Intelligence Cubed (i³)

> The **Nasdaq for AI models** — a decentralized **Modelverse** where models are both **Model-as-a-Service (MaaS)** and **liquid, revenue-sharing assets**. Discover, compare, and compose models in a visual Canvas; pay per call with transparent PHRS pricing; and get verifiable on-chain receipts via **x402**.

---

## 1) Overview

**Intelligence Cubed (i³)** is the **Nasdaq for AI models** — a decentralized modelverse that lets users:

- Discover curated AI models with transparent **PHRS** pricing  
- Benchmark and compare models with community-driven **Proof of Intelligence**  
- Build and run multi-step workflows in a **Canvas** editor  
- Chat with any model or workflow via a unified **Chats** interface

Every paid action (single model call or workflow run) is **gated by x402 invoices** and settled in **PHRS on Pharos Testnet** via **MetaMask**. Only **after** on-chain payment confirmation does the app invoke the underlying model(s) and stream back the answer.

---

## 2) What the Product *Is*

i³ is four layers that work together:

1. **Model-as-a-Service (MaaS)**  
   Call models directly via chat/API, chain them into workflows, and enable fine-tuning and secondary creation.

2. **Model as a Liquid Asset**  
   Tokenize models through **IMO (Initial Model Offering)** so ownership and usage revenues are shared transparently.

3. **Co-Creation (Canvas)**  
   Drag-and-drop to compose multi-step pipelines; derivative models automatically return royalties to ancestors.

4. **Democratic Benchmark (Proof of Intelligence)**  
   Usage-driven rankings and indices so the best models rise on merit, not just lab tests.

> **Open-source threshold:** when **>51%** of a model's ownership is publicly held, the model transitions to open source to accelerate adoption and remixing.

---

## 3) Problem & Solution

### Problems
- **Model discovery gap:** Lists are long, quality varies, pricing is opaque, and router logic is often a black box.  
- **Payment gap:** Most AI apps are centralized, credit- or subscription-based. There's no standard way for third-party agents to **programmatically** pay per call and obtain **verifiable on-chain receipts**.

### Our Solution
- **Modelverse + Benchmark + Workflows + Canvas** for one-stop **discover → compare → compose**.  
- **Tokenized ownership & royalties** (IMO + derivative revenue share) for sustainable creator incentives.  
- **Unified x402 payment layer**: each call is invoiced, paid, verified on-chain, then executed.

---

## 4) Core Concepts

- **IMO (Initial Model Offering):** Creators mint model ownership, fund development, and share future usage revenues.  
- **Royalties Accumulation:** Derivative models automatically pay upstream royalties across the lineage.  
- **Proof of Intelligence:** Continuous, usage-driven scoring and vertical indices (quality, usage, momentum).  
- **Democratic Pricing:** Stablecoin-anchored pricing that reflects demand and capacity, not arbitrary fees.

  * **Two payment modes**: Prepay once (single tx for all nodes) or Pay per node.

* **Canvas (`canvas.html`)**  
  Visual workflow editor:

  * Drag-and-drop nodes (models)
  * Connect them into multi-step pipelines
  * Click **Run** to execute — choose **Prepay once** or **Pay per node**.

* **MyCart (`mycart.html`)**  
  Shopping cart for bulk purchases:

  * Add models from Modelverse to cart.
  * Purchase **API call tokens** (prepaid credits) and **ownership shares**.
  * Batch checkout with x402 payment.

### x402 & On-chain Payments

* **402 Payment Progress widget** in the bottom-right shows:

  * Invoice status (Pending → Paid / Cancelled)
  * Amount, memo, and Pharos tx link.
* **MetaMask (Pharos Testnet)** integration:

  * Users log in and confirm each payment.
  * Every payment is visible on **Pharos Explorer (SocialScan)**.
* **Prepaid Credits**: Pre-purchase API calls; use them later without additional payments.
* **Daily Check-in**: Claim daily PHRS rewards to offset usage costs.

---

## 4️⃣ How x402 & Pharos Payments Work

### A. Single-Model Chat Flow

1. User opens **Chats** (`index.html`), selects a model (or enables Auto Router), and sends a question, e.g. `"What does this do?"`.
2. The frontend sends the request to the MCP server; the server:

   * Calculates the model price in PHRS.
   * Creates a **x402 payment** describing the required payment.
3. The UI shows a **x402 Payment Progress** card and prompts the user to **connect MetaMask (Pharos Testnet)**.
4. MetaMask pops up:

   * User approves the PHRS transfer (plus small gas fee).
5. Once the transaction is confirmed:

   * The 402 card shows **Paid – Payment settled on Pharos**, including:

     * Amount (PHRS)
     * Memo (invoice ID)
     * `Tx` link to **Pharos Explorer**.
6. Only then does the MCP server forward the prompt to the selected model and stream the answer back into the chat.

### B. Modelverse / Benchmark "Try" Flow

1. User visits **Modelverse** or **Benchmark** and clicks **Try** next to a model.
2. They are redirected to **Chats** with that model pre-selected.
3. They ask a question; the **same x402 flow** (invoice → MetaMask → Explorer → answer) runs automatically.

### C. Workflow & Canvas Flow

Users can run multi-model workflows with **two payment options**:

#### Option 1: Prepay Once (Recommended)
Pay a single transaction upfront for all nodes in the workflow.

1. User opens **Workflows** and clicks **Pay with x402** on a workflow card.
2. A dialog appears: **"Prepay once"** vs. **"Pay per node"** — user selects **Prepay once**.
3. The app requests a **single x402 invoice** covering all nodes:
   * Backend calculates total cost = Σ (compute cost + gas) for all nodes.
   * Returns a 402 with a detailed **cost breakdown** per node.
4. User pays once via MetaMask (single transaction).
5. After payment verification, the user receives a **workflow_session_id**.
6. The app opens **Canvas** (or redirects to **Chats**); all nodes execute **without additional payments**.

#### Option 2: Pay Per Node
Pay for each node separately as it executes.

1. User selects **Pay per node** in the dialog.
2. The app opens **Canvas**, pre-loading the workflow graph.
3. User clicks **Run**; backend returns a 402 for the **first node only**.
4. User pays via MetaMask; node executes.
5. Backend returns a 402 for the **next node**; repeat until all nodes complete.
6. Final results surface back through the **Chats** interface.

| Mode | Transactions | Use Case |
|------|--------------|----------|
| **Prepay Once** | 1 | Run entire workflow seamlessly |
| **Pay Per Node** | N (one per node) | Review/cancel midway |

### D. Prepaid API Calls (Token Purchase)

Users can **pre-purchase API calls** from Modelverse or MyCart. Once purchased, subsequent model invocations are **free** until the credits are exhausted.

1. User visits **Modelverse** and clicks **Buy Tokens** (or adds to cart via **MyCart**).
2. An x402 invoice is generated for the desired number of API calls.
3. User pays via MetaMask; tokens are credited to their account.
4. When the user later invokes the same model:
   * Frontend detects **prepaid credits** in `localStorage`.
   * Sends a special header: `X-PAYMENT: prepaid model=xxx; remaining=N; nonce=...`
   * Backend **skips payment verification** and executes the model directly.
   * Remaining credits are decremented locally.
5. When credits reach zero, the user must purchase more or pay per-call.

### E. Share (Model Ownership) Purchase

Users can buy **ownership shares** of AI models via the `/mcp/share.buy` endpoint:

1. User selects a model and chooses **Buy Shares**.
2. Backend generates an x402 invoice for the share price × quantity.
3. User pays via MetaMask; shares are recorded in **My Assets**.
4. Share ownership enables:
   * Revenue sharing from model usage fees.
   * Governance rights (future roadmap).
   * Open-source transition when >51% is publicly held.

### Architecture Components

#### 1. **Frontend Layer** (HTML/CSS/JavaScript + Vite)
- Multi-page application with distinct interfaces
- **x402 Payment Progress Widget** for real-time payment status
- MetaMask wallet integration for Pharos Testnet
- Real-time streaming responses from AI models
- Responsive design with modern UI/UX

#### 2. **Application Layer** (Node.js/Express)
- RESTful API endpoints (`/api/*`)
- **MCP Server routes** (`/mcp/*`) for x402 payment handling
- Model selection and routing logic (Auto Router)
- Session and state management
- I3 Gateway for model orchestration

#### 3. **Blockchain Layer - Pharos Testnet**
- **Pharos Testnet**: Fast, low-cost blockchain for testing
- **PHRS Token**: ERC-20 standard payment token
- **MetaMask Wallet**: User authentication and payment approval
- **On-Chain Verification**: Every payment is verifiable on Pharos Explorer
- **Transaction Receipts**: Immutable proof of payment

#### 4. **x402 Payment Layer**
- **Invoice Creation**: Generate payment requests with PHRS amounts
- **Payment Polling**: Real-time status updates (Pending → Paid → Verified)
- **On-Chain Verification**: Confirm PHRS transfers on Pharos
- **Receipt Generation**: Provide Pharos Explorer links for each transaction
- **Billing Logs**: Local JSON logging for reconciliation

#### 5. **AI Model Layer**
- Multiple AI model providers
- I3 Gateway for unified model access
- Response streaming for real-time interactions
- Usage tracking and analytics
- Pay-per-call execution model

#### 6. **Data Layer**
- **Model Registry**: Metadata, pricing, and capability information
- **Billing Entries**: `data/billing-entries.json` for transaction logs
- **User Profiles**: Wallet-based identity and transaction history

### Data Flow Summary

1. **User Action** → Frontend captures intent (chat query, workflow execution)
2. **x402 Invoice** → Create payment request with PHRS amount
3. **MetaMask Approval** → User approves PHRS transfer on Pharos Testnet
4. **Payment Verification** → Confirm on-chain transaction
5. **Model Selection** → Auto Router or user selects appropriate model(s)
6. **API Request** → Forward to I3 Gateway after payment confirmation
7. **Model Execution** → Execute AI model and stream response
8. **On-Chain Receipt** → Generate verifiable Pharos Explorer link
9. **Billing Log** → Record transaction in local JSON for reconciliation

## 8️⃣ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* **Node.js** ≥ 18
* **npm** ≥ 8 (or `yarn`)
* **MetaMask** wallet installed in your browser, configured with **Pharos Testnet**
* Optional but recommended: some testnet ETH (for gas) & PHRS in MetaMask for testing.

### Pharos Testnet Configuration

Add Pharos Testnet to MetaMask with the following settings:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Network Name | Pharos Testnet |
| RPC URL | `https://testnet.dplabs-internal.com` |
| Chain ID | `688688` |
| Currency Symbol | ETH |
| Block Explorer | `https://pharos-testnet.socialscan.io` |

### Clone & Install

```bash
git clone <TODO: repository-url>
cd Pharos_i3_app
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### Environment Variables

You can export these in your shell or use a `.env` file (with `dotenv` wired into `serve.js`):

* **Server basics**

  * `PORT` – default `3000` (often mapped to `8080` in production)
  * `HOST` – default `127.0.0.1` (use `0.0.0.0` to listen on all interfaces)
  * `NODE_ENV` – `development` or `production`

* **Model proxy**

  * `I3_PROXY_BASE` – base URL of the proxy (e.g. `http://localhost:8000`)

* **x402 / Pharos settings** (can also live in `server/mcp/config.js`)

  * `X402_NETWORK` – e.g. `pharos-testnet`
  * `X402_TOKEN_ADDRESS` – PHRS token contract address on Pharos Testnet
  * `X402_RECIPIENT` – your merchant/agent wallet address
  * `X402_PAYMENT_URL` – optional x402 facilitator endpoint
  * `X402_EXPLORER_URL` – Pharos Explorer base URL (`https://pharos-testnet.socialscan.io`)
  * `X402_RPC_URL` – Pharos Testnet RPC endpoint
  * `X402_DECIMALS` – token decimals (usually `18` for PHRS)
  * `X402_EXPIRES_SECONDS` – invoice expiry duration in seconds

Ensure that `data/billing-entries.json` exists, is writable, and follows `{ "entries": [] }`. The repo ships with a sample file; replace it with an empty structure if you need a clean slate.

## 9️⃣ Local Development

### Frontend (Vite dev server)

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

* Default: `http://localhost:3000`
* Hot reload enabled.
* `vite.config.js` is configured with `host: '0.0.0.0'` so you can access it from other devices on your LAN.

### Backend / MCP server

In a separate terminal:

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

This launches `serve.js`, which:

* Serves static files (for production build)
* Exposes `/api/*` and `/mcp/*` routes
* Handles 402 invoice creation, polling, and post-payment model calls

### Production Build

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview     # optional local preview of the built assets
```

In production, you typically:

1. `npm run build`
2. `npm start` (or `node serve.js`) behind a reverse proxy.

---

## 🔮 Roadmap

* **Mainnet deployment** with production-grade RPC and observability.
* **Model provider onboarding**:

  * Let external developers list models/workflows with their own x402 pricing and recipient addresses.
* **More wallets & platforms**:

  * Support additional EVM-compatible wallets (WalletConnect, Coinbase Wallet, etc.) and mobile-first flows.
* **Agent API**:

  * Document and expose MCP endpoints so external AI agents can programmatically:

    * Discover models
    * Quote prices
    * Pay with x402
    * Invoke models and workflows
